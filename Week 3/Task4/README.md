# Task 4

- Write a Python program to find and print the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive). Additionally, for each even number, if it is a multiple of 3, print "Three" instead of the number; if it is a multiple of 5, print "Five" instead of the number. Finally, print the total sum and the count of numbers replaced with "Three" or "Five."
